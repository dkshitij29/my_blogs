    <h4>Why writing Technical Blogs?</h4>
    <div class="nested-container">
    Hey wonderful readers, I hope you're in good health while reading this blog. It feels like I'm following a trend in terms of writing blogs.<br><br>
    
    It almost feels like I'm being an imposter, considering I used to have little to no interaction with people. Does that sound relatable? But things are different in my case. I generally tend to assume that every homosapien on this planet is interested in the tech world ðŸ˜‚. Sounds funny, right? But this assumption has backfired on me in many cases. This mindset of mine has led me to believe that everyone I meet is into tech and has the same level of insight. Consequently, I often end up discussing things too technically, which sometimes ruins the flow of the conversation. This happens with almost everyone, including my parents, family, relatives, and friends. I do have a group of geeky friends who are all into tech, so when we meet, we have a blast. But that circle isn't always available.
    
    <br><br>
    The internet is a beautiful tool that has erased boundaries. Hence, my blogs exist to connect and have a good time with all the techies out there across the globe. The main goal is to reach out and hang out with geeks and tech nerds worldwide, resulting in deeper dives and more technical content (remember the first paragraph? ðŸ˜‚ Just kidding!!).
    
    <br><br>
    I'll be posting content weekly (on Sundays). Feel free to reach out to me on my handles for networking and to suggest topics.
